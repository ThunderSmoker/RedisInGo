In this challenge,I built a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way I learnt about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.


# USAGE


1. Ensure you have `go (1.19)` installed locally
2. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `app/server.go`.
3. And You are ready to Go!
